ArrayList class
===============
It is an implementation of List interface
It means ArrayList class has implemented all methods of List interface
ArrayList creates and uses resizable array of size 10 and type E to store/hold elements
(Remember size of the array is fixed in can't be changed)
int newCapacity = oldCapacity + (oldCapacity >> 1);

ArrayList<String> list1=new ArrayList<String>();
This collection will create and resizable array of type String and size 10 to store elements
It means in above collection our program can keep String type elements(Reference of String class object)

ArrayList<Product> list2=new ArrayList<Product>();
This collection will create and resizable array of type Product and size 10 to store elements
It means in above collection our program can keep Product type elements(Reference of Product class object)

ArrayList list3=new ArrayList();
This collection will create and resizable array of type Object and size 10 to store elements
It means in above collection our program can keep every type elements(Reference of every java class object)
