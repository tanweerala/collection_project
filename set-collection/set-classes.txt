HashSet class
==============
It is implementation of Set interface
It creates and uses instance/object of HashMap class to keep elements
HashSet has all methods of Collection interface
We can call these methods to manage elements

LinkedHashSet class
===================
It is implementation of Set interface and child of HashSet class
LinkedHashSet maintains insertion order of elements

TreeSet class
==============
It is an implementation of SortedSet interface
SortedSet interface is a child of Set interface
So TreeSet keep elements in the sorted manner(ascending order or descending order)
TreeSet calls compareTo() method of Comparable interface to sort elements
String class and all wrapper classes has already overridden this method
Class of elements must implement Comparable interface otherwise ClassCastException will be created and thrown by TreeSet collection
