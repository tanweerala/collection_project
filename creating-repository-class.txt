Creating repository/dao class
------------------------------
Define a class and write code to perform database operation inside this class
Remember database operation will be performed by hibernate not your program
Use following interfaces of hibernate inside this class
1)SessionFactory interface
2)Session interface
3)Transaction interface
etc
Our program(repository class) will call methods of these interfaces to perform database opreations
