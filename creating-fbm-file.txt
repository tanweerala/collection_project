Creating hbm file
=================
(hbm means hibernate mapping)
This(hbm file) is an xml file
We will have to create this file
In this file we will have to configure mapping between persistent class and table
This configuration will be used by hibernate

<hibernate-mapping> 
  <class name="com.cetpa.Person" table="personinfo">
   <id name="pid" column="pid">
    <generator class="assigned" />
   </id>
   <property name="name" column="name"/>
   <property name="address" column="address"/>
   <property name="phone" column="phone"/>
  </class>	   
</hibernate-mapping>
