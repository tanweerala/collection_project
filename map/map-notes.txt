Map interface
=============
It is not child of Collection interface
Map interface has functionality to keep elements in key-value pair
Map treates each element as value
put() method of Map interface should be called to add elements into map
It accepts following two objects
1)Key
2)Value
Key will always be unique in map

HashMap class
=============
It is implementation of Map interface
It keep elements in key-value pair
Each key-value pair inside map is known as entry
An object of Map.Entry interface is created to hold both key and value

HashMap<String,String> map=new HashMap<String,String>();
map.put("amit","9919875298");
map.put("rahul","5566778899");
map.put("imran","4455667788");

LinkedHashMap class
===================
It is a child of HashMap class and implementation of Map interface
It maintains insertion order of entries

TreeMap class
=============
It is implementation of SortedMap interface
SortedMap interface is a sub/child interface of Map interface
TreeMap keep entries in the ascending or descending  order of keys
